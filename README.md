1) Big 3 of tennis grand slams dataset was downloaded from kaggle.
2) This was a very small dataset used to showcase minimal level proficiency in spreadsheets and tableau.
3) Questions that i wanted to answer from this dataset were: 
  a) Is there any one country that produces more men's tennis grand slam champions?
  b) What are the winning trends of the so called "big 3" since 2004?
  c) Is there any one grand slam that the big 3 have won less?
  
4) Data cleaning was performed to make sure that there are no null values.
5) Results are reported in the pdf file.
